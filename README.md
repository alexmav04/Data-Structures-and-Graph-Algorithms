## 1-Date-Data-Type
* Input *yyyy/mm/dd*
* Output *MonthName dd, yyyy*
* functions
  1. DayOfWeek(date)  
    enter *2020/09/17*  
    print *September 17, 2020 is Thursday*
  2. DateSub(date1, date2)  
    enter *2020/09/17-2020/09/30*  
    print *13 days from September 17, 2020 to September 30, 2020*
  3. DateAdd(date, n)  
    enter *2020/09/17+60*  
    print *60 days after September 17, 2020 is November 16, 2020*
